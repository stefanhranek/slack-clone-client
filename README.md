# Slack Clone

Building a clone of Slack, a collaboration hub that can replace email to help you and your team work together seamlessly. I'll be tweaking the styling a bit to make it sort of my own.

## Built With

* [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The web framework used
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [ROME](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - Used to generate RSS Feeds
